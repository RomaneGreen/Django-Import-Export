Contact: Marva Alette 410-396-3124
What is it?
When available, the Homeownership Assistance Program, can give qualified
first time homebuyers $5,000 toward downpayment and settlement expenses.
Who is eligible?
First-time homebuyers with a counseling certificate from a City Approved Counseling
Agency. Upon receiving a counseling certificate, the borrower can then find a property
and sign a contract to purchase. Once executing a contract, the borrower must bring
that contract back to the counseling agency to have the CDBG program application
completed. The property must be inspected utilizing an HQS inspection conducted by
a certified lead abatement inspector. Please be absolutely certain that there is no peeling,
flaking, chipping paint inside or outside the purchased property.
If there is chipped, pealing, flaking or otherwise deteriorating paint, it must be
tested for lead based paint, and if necessary, abated prior to closing. Borrower must
ensure that an Inspector certified to conduct Lead Paint Abatement inspection has
completed the lead abatement inspection and a copy of the certificate must be provided to the Office of Homeownership prior to closing. Buyers should receive the
“Seller Lead Based Paint Disclosure and EPA Pamphlet” from the housing
counseling agency when evaluating the merits of a house.
Additionally, if you qualify for other mortgage incentive programs, you can “stack”
these incentives to pay all of your closing cost expenses and may have enough residual
to reduce your mortgage principal. We have witnessed homebuyers “stacking” more
than $20,000 in incentive funds.
What are the benefits?
$5,000 down payment and closing assistance structured as a 5-year loan forgivable
20 percent per year.
What are the restrictions/loan terms?
The funding source for the Homeownership Assistance Program have 80% median

Affordable Loan Solution Program,Bank of America,3% Down Mortgage,,"Bank of America offers the Affordable Loan Solution Mortgage Program to help low-to-moderate income home buyers afford mortgages. The Affordable Loan Solution program, offered in conjunction with with Self-Help Ventures Fund and Freddie Mac, enables home buyers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% of the property purchase price with no minimum borrower financial contribution and no private mortgage insurance (PMI).

The most important feature of the Affordable Loan Solution program is that the borrower is NOT required to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) or mortgage insurance premium (MIP)

Bank of America, Self-Help and Freddie Mac are collaborating on the Affordable Loan Solution program to offer borrowers a low down payment mortgage option that potentially saves them money as compared to other mortgage programs. Self-Help is a community development lender that focuses on borrowers underserved by traditional financial institutions. Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise that provides mortgage capital to lenders. In short, Freddie Mac buys mortgages from lenders which in turn enables lenders to offer more mortgages.

The Affordable Loan Solution Mortgage Program competes with the Wells Fargo yourFirst Mortgage, Fannie Mae HomeReady and FHA Mortgage programs. These programs also enable borrowers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% - 3.5% and no personal financial contribution. The programs, however, require borrowers to pay PMI or FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP) which is an additional expense on top of your monthly mortgage payment. By eliminating PMI, the Affordable Loan Solution Program reduces your total monthly housing expense and potentially saves you money as compared to other no or down payment programs.

Review our comprehensive Comparison of Low / No Down Payment Mortgage Programs
Borrowers can combine a Affordable Loan Solution mortgage with a personal gift, employer program, down payment grant, closing cost assistance program or qualified subordinated second mortgage to pay for a down payment, closing costs or property renovations, allowing the borrower to purchase a home with no personal financial contribution. Down payment and closing cost assistance grants as well as qualified subordinated second mortgages, also referred to as Community Second mortgages, are provided through state or local housing agencies or commissions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.freeandclear.com/programs/affordable-loan-solution-mortgage-overview.html

Bank of America, Self-Help and Freddie Mac are collaborating on the Affordable Loan Solution program to offer borrowers a low down payment mortgage option that potentially saves them money as compared to other mortgage programs. Self-Help is a community development lender that focuses on borrowers underserved by traditional financial institutions. Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise that provides mortgage capital to lenders. In short, Freddie Mac buys mortgages from lenders which in turn enables lenders to offer more mortgages.

The Affordable Loan Solution Mortgage Program competes with the Wells Fargo yourFirst Mortgage, Fannie Mae HomeReady and FHA Mortgage programs. These programs also enable borrowers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% - 3.5% and no personal financial contribution. The programs, however, require borrowers to pay PMI or FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP) which is an additional expense on top of your monthly mortgage payment. By eliminating PMI, the Affordable Loan Solution Program reduces your total monthly housing expense and potentially saves you money as compared to other no or down payment programs.

Chenoa Fund Down Payment Assistance Loans,CBC Mortgage Agency,,,"While many people do manage to purchase a home by saving for a down payment over a period of years, increasing home prices and stagnant or low wages can make this quite difficult. By helping responsible home buyers to overcome the challenge of the minimum investment required for a mortgage, CBCMA is helping to create healthy communities by improving the balance between home ownership and other types of housing. This way, new homeowners can start now building equity for their future, rather than potentially waiting for years to save a down payment while home prices may become even more unaffordable. CBCMA offers down payment assistance to those who qualify for a 97% LTV conventional first mortgage under Fannie Mae®’s HomeReady® program1 for low to moderate income borrowers, with expanded eligibility for homes in low-income communities. If you do not fit the HomeReady® criteria but may not have the resources for a larger down payment on a home purchase, you may still qualify for the standard conventional 97% loan-to-value program and receive assistance from CBC Mortgage Agency for the down payment and some closing costs.



There are no household income limits under a conventional standard 97% LTV program. You will need to meet minimum credit score of 640 and all other guidelines for the conventional standard 97% LTV or HomeReady® programs. CBCMA’s correspondent guidelines may include additional overlays to the HomeRead® program. 2 *

The DreaMaker Program enables eligible borrowers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% of the property purchase price and no minimum borrower contribution. Using the program, borrowers can hold 3% of equity in their home when the mortgage closes without using any of their personal funds to make the down payment. By potentially lowering the amount of money home buyers are required to contribute to purchase a home and making mortgages more attainable, the DreaMaker Mortgage Program reduces the barriers to home ownership for people with limited financial resources.

The Chase DreaMaker Mortgage program competes with government-backed low / no down payment mortgage programs such as the FHA, VA and USDA programs as well as conventional low / no down payment programs such as the Bank of America Affordable Loan Solution, Wells Fargo yourFirst Mortgage and Fannie Mae Home Ready programs. Similar to these other programs, the DreaMaker Program requires a down payment of 3%.

HomeRun Mortgage Program,Citibank,3% Down Mortgage,,"The Citi HomeRun Mortgage Program enables borrowers with low-to-moderate incomes to afford mortgages and buy homes. The HomeRun Mortgage Program enables eligible borrowers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% of the property purchase price for a single family home, 5.0% for a condo or co-op and 10% for a two unit property. Unlike other low or no down payment mortgage programs, the HomeRun Program requires borrowers to make a minimum personal financial contribution of 1% toward their down payment for a single family home and 5% for a two unit home. The remaining portion of the down payment can come from a gift or down payment assistance program.

One of the key advantages of the Citi HomeRun Program is that borrowers are not required to pay an upfront or ongoing private mortgage insurance (PMI) fee, which reduces their closing costs and total monthly housing expense as compared to similar programs. By reducing the amount of funds borrowers are required to contribute when they purchase a home and making home loans more affordable, the Citi HomeRun Mortgage Program makes home ownership more attainable for borrowers with limited financial resources.

The Citi HomeRun Mortgage program competes with government-backed low / no down payment mortgage programs such as the FHA, VA and USDA programs as well as conventional low / no down payment programs such as the Bank of America Affordable Loan Solution, Chase DreaMaker Program, Wells Fargo yourFirst Mortgage and Fannie Mae Home Ready programs. Although similar to other programs, the Citi HomeRun Program requires a borrower financial contribution of 1% - 5%, depending on the property type, as compared to other programs that require no borrower financial contribution and enable borrowers to pay for 100% of their down payment through a gift or down payment grant. The HomeRun Program, however, offers market mortgage rates that are competitive to conventional programs and requires no PMI fees, which make it more affordable to buy a home.

Section 184 Loan Program,Department of Housing and Urban Development,0% Down Mortgage,,"The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers the Section 184 Loan Program to enable eligible Native Americans to buy a home with a low down payment and at attractive mortgage rates as compared to conventional mortgage programs. The HUD Section 184 Loan Program was established in 1992 to increase home ownership and improve access to mortgage financing in Native American communities. HUD guarantees 100% of the mortgage amount for Section 184 loans, which protects the lender from losing money in the event that borrowers cannot repay their mortgage. Section 184 Loans are offered through participating Native American tribes through an approved third-party lender, such as a bank, mortgage bank, mortgage broker or credit union. Participating tribes agree to certain program guidelines addressing loan terms, property rights and land access. Because the program is only offered through participating Native American tribes, Section 184 Loans are only available in selected states and counties.

The key benefits of a Section 184 Loan is that you can purchase a home with a down payment as low as 2.25% (for mortgage amounts over $50,000) or 1.25% (for mortgage amounts below $50,000). Section 184 Loans also offer attractive mortgage rates and more flexible borrower qualification requirements, which help more borrowers qualify for mortgages to buy homes.

Standard 97% LTV Loan,Fannie Mae,3% Down Mortgage,,"Fannie Mae, one of the two largest agencies that buy and sell mortgages, offers a conventional homebuying program called the Standard 97% LTV loan through approved lenders.

A maximum 97% LTV ratio is allowed under this program, which means you’d only need a 3% down payment to cover the rest.

You may be eligible if:

You or a co-borrower are a first-time homebuyer (meaning you haven’t owned a home in the past three years)
One borrower has completed a homeownership education course (if all borrowers are first-timers)
All borrowers have a minimum 620-720 credit score, depending on your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and down payment contribution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://studentloanhero.com/featured/first-time-homebuyer-grants-programs/#first

The program is referred to as the Fannie Mae 97% LTV Ratio program because when you make a 3% down payment to buy a home, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, or the amount of your mortgage divided by the value of the property, is 97%. Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that develops mortgage programs and provides capital to lenders. Fannie Mae's mortgage programs are offered through approved lenders.

Fannie Mae's 3% Down Payment Mortgage Program represents a conventional alternative to government-backed low or no down payment programs such as the FHA, VA and USDA mortgage programs.

HomeReady Mortgage,Fannie Mae,3% Down Mortgage,,"Fannie Mae offers the HomeReady Mortgage Program to help home buyers with limited resources and alternate sources of income afford mortgages. In short, Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that develops mortgage programs and provides capital to lenders. Fannie Mae's mortgage programs are offered through approved lenders. The HomeReady Program replaced Fannie Mae’s MyCommunityMortgage Program and is designed to address the growth in the number of households with “extended-family” living arrangements such as cases where parents live with an adult child who wants to buy a home.

The HomeReady program enables home buyers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% of the property purchase price and no minimum borrower contribution. The program is similar to Fannie Mae's 97% LTV Mortgage Program but allows a borrower to include non-traditional sources of income which improves the borrower’s ability to qualify for the mortgage or enables the borrower to qualify for a higher mortgage amount. Typically when you apply for a mortgage only the borrower’s income is considered to determine your ability to qualify for a mortgage but with the HomeReady Mortgage Program three additional sources of income are factored into the qualification assessment:

Income from non-occupant borrower. This is income from a parent or relative who is a borrower on the mortgage but does reside in the property. For example, a mother’s income could help a daughter qualify for a mortgage to buy a property that only the daughter will own and live in. Both the mother’s and daughter’s income are included in determining the borrower’s ability to qualify for the mortgage and both are listed as borrowers on the mortgage. Income from a non-occupant borrower is considered qualifying income and is subject to income limits outlined below. Please note that if you use income from a non-occupant borrower to qualify for a HomeReady mortgage you are required to make a down payment of at least 5%, which means your maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 95%.
Income from boarders. Up to 30% of the income used to determine a borrower’s ability to qualify for the mortgage can come from boarders. For example, if you rent out your basement or a spare room, this rental income can be added to the borrower’s income to determine what size mortgage the borrower qualifies for
Income from non-borrower household member. This is income from a relative who resides in the property but who is not listed on the mortgage. In this case, the income is used to support the borrower's application. For example, if a father lives with his son, the father’s income may be considered by the lender and used to solidify the son's loan application. Please note that income from a non-borrower household member is not added to the applicant's income to determine the applicant's ability to qualify for the mortgage and only the applicant is listed as the borrower on the mortgage. Additionally, the non-borrower household income is not counted against the income limits outlined below.
The HomeReady program also has more flexible borrower qualification requirements especially as it relates to a borrower's credit profile. For example, a borrower with a credit score as low as 620 or with no or limited traditional credit history may be eligible for the program. We discuss qualification guidelines including credit profile guidelines in detail below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.freeandclear.com/programs/homeready-mortgage-overview.html

Home Possible Mortgage,Freddie Mac,3% Down Mortgage,,"Freddie Mac offers the Home Possible Mortgage Program to help home buyers with limited resources afford mortgages. The Home Possible program enables home buyers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% of the property purchase price and no minimum borrower financial contribution. The Home Possible program is similar to Fannie Mae’s HomeReady Mortgage Program.

Typically when you apply for a mortgage only the borrower’s wage income is considered to determine your ability to qualify for a mortgage but with the Home Possible Mortgage Program rental income is also factored into the qualification assessment. For example if you purchase a single family property and rent out a room, the rental income could help you to qualify for the mortgage. Additionally, if you purchase a multi-unit property, the rental income from the units you do not live in could help you qualify for the mortgage.

Please note that to use rental income to qualify for the mortgage on a single unit property you must verify that you received rental payments for at least nine months over the past year. If you have not received regular rental payments in the past, you may not be able to use rental income that you expect to receive in the future to qualify for the Home Possible program if you want to buy a one unit residence such as a home, condominium or coop.

The Home Possible Program also allows you to use a non-occupant co-borrower to qualify for the mortgage on a single family property. For example, one of your parents can be a co-borrower on your mortgage even if they do not live in the property with you. In this case, their monthly income and debt expense are included in your mortgage application. If he or she has solid income and relatively low debt, having a relative as a co-borrower can enhance your loan application and improve your ability to get approved for the loan.

HomeOne Mortgage,Freddie Mac,3% Down Mortgage,,"Freddie Mac’s HomeOne Mortgage Program enables you to buy a home with a 3% down payment and no personal financial contribution. The HomeOne Program is similar to Freddie Mac’s Home Possible program but offers several key advantages for borrowers. First, unlike the Home Possible Program, the HomeOne Program does not apply borrower income limits. This means that all borrowers are eligible to apply for the program regardless of how much money you make. Additionally, the HomeOne Program does not limit where the property being financed is located and property location does not impact your mortgage rates. These features are designed to make the program accessible to more borrowers and easier to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.freeandclear.com/programs/homeone-mortgage-program.html
Home Possible Loan,Freddie Mac,3% Down Mortgage,,"Freddie Mac’s Home Possible® loan is another first-time homebuyer program with the incentive of a low down payment. Repeat homebuyers are also eligible for this mortgage. Still, no matter which type of buyer you are, you must meet income limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://studentloanhero.com/featured/first-time-homebuyer-grants-programs/#first
Your Path Mortgage Program,Freddie Mac,3% Down Mortgage,,"The Your Path Mortgage Program is designed to help individuals with low-to-moderate incomes or alternate sources of income qualify for mortgages. The program is offered through a collaboration between Freddie Mac, Alterra Home Loans and New American Funding. Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise that provides capital to lenders and works with lenders to develop mortgage programs for borrowers. Alterra Home Loans and New American Funding are lenders that focus on underserved borrowers, particularly minority populations.

The Your Path Program is based on Freddie Mac’s low down payment Home Possible Mortgage Program. Like the Home Possible Program, the Your Path Program requires a down payment of only 3% and no personal financial contribution from the borrower to buy a home. Additionally, as outlined below, the two programs have many of the same borrower qualification requirements and program eligibility guidelines.

Both programs also allow applicants to include income from non-borrower household members such as relatives or boarders to qualify for the mortgage or improve the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, which may allow you to get approved for a larger mortgage. For example if you purchase a single family property and relatives or boarders intend to live with you in the property for at least twelve months then you can use the income from the individuals to qualify for the mortgage, even though they are not co-borrowers and do not own the home. Additionally, if you purchase a multi-family property (up to four units), the rental income from the units you do not occupy could help you qualify for the mortgage.

Although there is significant overlap between the two program, the Your Path Mortgage Program offers several unique and innovative features intended to make it easier for borrowers to qualify for a mortgage. Key differentiators of the Your Path Mortgage Program include:

The ability to include borrower income from a second job with only twelve months of work history instead of two years of history
More options for self-employed borrowers to demonstrate their income
Enhanced flexibility to include income from seasonal employment
Reduced bank documentation required to demonstrate proof of a down payment
These features, along with permitting non-borrower household income to be used to qualify for a mortgage, are designed to address the growth in multi-generational households as well as the increasing number of borrowers with non-traditional sources of income. By applying more flexible borrower qualification requirements, the Your Path Mortgage Program makes home ownership accessible to more people.

The Your Path Program competes with conventional low / no down payment programs such as the HomeReady Mortgage Program, Bank of America Affordable Loan Solution Program and Wells Fargo yourFirst Mortgage Program as well as government-backed programs such as the FHA, VA and USDA programs. Be sure to compare and understand multiple low / no down payment mortgage programs to find the one that best meets your needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.freeandclear.com/programs/your-path-mortgage-program-overview.html

yourFirst Mortgage®,Wells Fargo,3% Down Mortgage,,"Wells Fargo launched the yourFirst Mortgage Program to help first-time home buyers and low-to-moderate income borrowers afford mortgages. The yourFirst Mortgage Program, offered in conjunction with with Self-Help and Fannie Mae, enables home buyers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% of the property purchase price and no minimum borrower contribution.

Wells Fargo, Fannie Mae and Self-Help cooperated to develop the yourFirst Mortgage Program to offer borrowers a low down payment mortgage option that is potentially less complex and more borrower-friendly than other programs. Wells Fargo is one of the biggest mortgage lenders in the country. Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that provides mortgage capital to lenders. In short, Fannie Mae buys mortgages from lenders such as Wells Fargo which in turn enables lenders to offer more mortgages. Self-Help is a community development lender that focuses on borrowers underserved by traditional financial institutions.

The borrower can combine the yourFirst Mortgage Program with a personal gift, employer program, down payment grant or closing cost assistance program to pay for a down payment or closing costs, allowing the borrower to buy a home with no personal financial contribution. Down payment and closing cost assistance grants are provided through state or local housing agencies or commissions.

Review information on down payment grants and other mortgage assistance programs in your state STATE PROGRAMS
Unlike many other low or no down payment mortgage programs, yourFirst Mortgage participants are not required to take a homebuyer counseling class although borrowers that make a down payment of less than 10% may be able to reduce their interest rate by .125% by completing a HUD-approved homebuyer education course. Additionally, the yourFirst Mortgage Program does not apply borrower income limits or restrict where a property is located, making the program accessible to more homebuyers in more locations.

The Wells Fargo yourFirst Mortgage Program competes with the Bank of America Affordable Loan Solution Program, the Fannie Mae HomeReady Program and the FHA Mortgage Program. These programs also enable borrowers to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3.0% - 3.5% and no personal financial contribution. In some ways, yourFirst Mortgage takes some of the best parts of these other programs and puts them into a single program for low-to-moderate income borrowers. For example, similar to the HomeReady Mortgage Program, yourFirst Mortgage considers non-traditional credit profiles and income from non-borrower household members, such as relatives or boarders, to determine a borrower’s ability to qualify for a mortgag",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.freeandclear.com/programs/wells-fargo-yourfirst-mortgage-program-overview.html
